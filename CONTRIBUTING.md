# Contributing to gamesung

Thank you for your interest in contributing to gamesung! This document provides guidelines and steps for contributing.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the Repository

Click the **Fork** button at the top right of the [repository page](https://github.com/rekabytes/gamesung) to create your own copy.

### 2. Clone Your Fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/gamesung.git
cd gamesung
```

### 3. Set Up Remote

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/rekabytes/gamesung.git
git remote -v
```

### 4. Create a Branch

Always create a new branch from `main`. Branch name must match the GitHub issue.

```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git checkout -b issue/<issue-number>-<short-description>
```

**Examples:**
- `issue/42-add-timeout-chess`
- `issue/108-fix-bot-move-validation`
- `issue/156-update-api-docs`

**Branch naming:**

| Prefix | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `issue/<number>/` | Work related to a GitHub issue |

### 5. Make Your Changes

- Follow the existing code style
- Keep commits small and focused
- Write clear commit messages

### 6. Commit

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "type: short description

Optional longer description explaining the change."
```

**Commit message format:**
- `feat:` — new feature
- `fix:` — bug fix
- `docs:` — documentation
- `refactor:` — code refactor
- `test:` — adding tests
- `chore:` — maintenance tasks

### 7. Push to Your Fork

```bash
git push origin <your-branch>
```

### 8. Create a Pull Request

1. Go to the original repository
2. Click **New Pull Request**
3. Select `main` as the base branch
4. Select your branch as the compare branch
5. Fill in the PR template:
   - **Title:** Clear, concise description
   - **Description:** What changed and why
   - **Related Issue:** Link to the issue (e.g., "Closes #42")

## Resolving Merge Conflicts

CI uses `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, which **fails if the lockfile is out of sync** with `package.json`. This prevents broken lockfiles (with conflict markers, duplicate keys, etc.) from being merged into `main`.

If you encounter merge conflicts in `pnpm-lock.yaml` or `package.json`, follow these steps on your PR branch:

```bash
git checkout issue/<issue-number>-<short-description>
git merge main
# Resolve conflicts in package.json and pnpm-lock.yaml
pnpm install
git add .
git commit -m "chore: resolve merge conflicts"
git push origin issue/<issue-number>-<short-description>
```

**Do not** resolve lockfile conflicts on GitHub's web editor. Always resolve locally and run `pnpm install` to regenerate a clean lockfile before pushing.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- One feature/fix per PR
- PR should target the `main` branch
- Keep PRs small and focused
- Describe what you changed and why
- Reference any related issues
- Ensure the build passes before submitting

## Code Style

### TypeScript/React (Frontend)
- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Follow existing component patterns

## Issues

- Label issues appropriately

## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and inclusive
